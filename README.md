<h1>Stock Portfolio Scoring & Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a dynamic Excel-based system to evaluate 122 stocks based on key metrics such as EPS-LTM Slope, EPS-LTM RÂ², Revenue Slope, and Revenue RÂ². Integrated VBA macros to automate slope and RÂ² calculations across 100+ stock sheets. SQL queries were used to clean and standardize the raw stock data (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring correct date formats) before importing into Excel for scoring. The project includes ranking, scoring, and normalizing stocks out of 10 using both binary and dynamic scoring systems. Interactive Excel dashboards and charts (top 10 performers, heatmaps, and stacked contribution graphs) are included for visualization.

<b>      *Note: The raw stock data is not uploaded due to confidentiality, but a sample dashboard and screenshots are shared to demonstrate the project workflow and analysis.

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Mac OS</b>
- <b>Microsoft Excel 365</b>
